- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

My initial impressions of how 'Encapsulation' affects my programming are good. I think encapsulation helps with aesthetics because I feel like my train class looked neater from using the encapsulation. It also helped me to moderate how much of the assignment I worked on at once. I can become easily overwhelmed so I think having separate classes and working on one class at a time was a good strategy.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Some things that worked for me were copy and pasting the readme and rubric into a google doc and annotating the doc and writing as much psuedocode as I could. I've realized that I struggle a lot with these assignments because I don't read everything and ensure that I have a fundmental understainding of what is being asked of me, so these strategies really helped me. I was able to note which methods/objects needed to be public or provate before I even began writing the code and really understood how each of the classes interacted with one another.

What didn't work for me was trying to follow a realistic train model when writing my code. For example, I wasted a lot of time trying to write a go method that was continuously decreasing the fuel as time passed and once I went to TA hours, they told me that I actually did too much work. I definitely overcomplicated this process, but I do think I learned some good strategies for more complicated projects in doing so.
